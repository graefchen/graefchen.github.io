This here is my attempt to characterise the ATW([Artur Whitney](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Whitney_(computer_scientist)>)) style of C.

The following document will be updated over time the more I get to know about
this particular dialect.

For reference I have used following sources:

1. [Origins of J](https://www.jsoftware.com/ioj/iojATW.htm), [explained](https://github.com/kelas/ooj)
2. [k/simple, explained](https://github.com/kparc/ksimple/)
3. [j](https://github.com/cratelyn/j)
4. ["Why k?"](https://xpqz.github.io/kbook/Introduction.html)
