# Writing in the ATW style

<!--
Some working titles:
- "Ters, Terser, ATW"
- "From codegolf to apl"
-->

This here is my attempt to characterise the
ATW([Artur Whitney](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Whitney_(computer_scientist)>))
style of C.

The following document will be updated over time the more I get to know about
this particular dialect.

For simple reference I have used following sources:

1. [Origins of J](https://www.jsoftware.com/ioj/iojATW.htm),
   [explained](https://github.com/kelas/ooj)
2. [k/simple, explained](https://github.com/kparc/ksimple/)
3. [j](https://github.com/cratelyn/j)
4. ["Why k?"](https://xpqz.github.io/kbook/Introduction.html)

As programming codebases these where used:

([this](https://k.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page) wiki helps enormously to find K
languages)

1. [oK](https://github.com/JohnEarnest/ok)
2. [ngn/K](https://codeberg.org/ngn/k/)
3. [kyte/i](https://github.com/ktye/i)
4. [kona](https://github.com/kevinlawler/kona)
5. _Possible more will follow_
