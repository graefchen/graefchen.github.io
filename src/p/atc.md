# Alternatives to C

Here I have some very good alternative system programming languages
that you can (and probably should) use instead of C/C++.

**What my prerequisites for a programming language are:**

- supports unicode
- has good suppport (community or company)
- compiles natively (or through llvm, etc.) to machine code
- unicode support

## Go

## Nim

## Odin

## Rust

## Zig
